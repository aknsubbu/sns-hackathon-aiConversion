# SNS-Hackathon-aiConversion

We have created a software that helps to convert news articles into MP4 videos where the articles are read out along with the visuals that are supplied across more than 160 languages
We currently have the code in the format of a python file that can be run. Enclosed we have the code for a flask server that can be run to make this process easy over an API. The server is not online due to some unfortunate build errors we have encountered at the time. We also have the code for a frontend that can be connected for this but it is missing two features which is why it is not hosted. We are working to add those features and host both the API and the frontend. Please bear with us......
